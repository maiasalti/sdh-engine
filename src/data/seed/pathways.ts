Clinically, SSTR2-expressing tumors are targeted by peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) using radiolabeled somatostatin analogues such as lutetium-177 DOTATATE (Lutathera), which exploits SSTR2-mediated internalization to deliver targeted radiation. SDH-deficient tumors are known to express SSTR2 and are detectable by 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT.",
